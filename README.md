# Brewery Locator Project
The Brewery Locator is my first project for Flatiron School.  This is the phase-1 project. This can be used to search for breweries using name, city, state, or type of brewery.  

### Features
* User can search for a brewery using search field
* User can select state on a map to search for a list of breweries form that state
* User can select the URL for the brewery(if applicable) to be taken to their page
